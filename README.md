# Instructions
___________________________________________________
  Note the bar at the top of the screen. This determines how much of the red, green, blue, and black resource you and your enemy share.
  
  Look at the bottom left of the screen. Here you can find your HP, turn count, and number of battles.
  
  Look at the bottom right of the screen. Here you can choose which skill to cast. 

  You have an option of 3 offensive skills, 2 defense skills, and the option to shuffle all your skills. If you do not have enough of the red/green/blue/black resource, the skill will not cast (Hint: this can happen to the enemy too!). 

  Look at the indication above your enemy. This shows you how much damage they will do, along with the resources they will consume.

  Click a skill in the bottom right of the screen when you are ready to start fighting!
